<h1>The Best Movies Objectively* Speaking</h1>
    <p>(*According to Wooyeoup)</p>

<h2>Nostalgic Films</h2>
<p>These films I grew up with or have rather fond memories with. And so, I can ignore any sort of flaws that they may have because of the lovely memories tied with them (despite the fact that this is an objectively* true list of great films).</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirited_Away">Spirited Away</a></h3>
    <p>A nostalgic movie for me. One that I grew up watching several tens of times whenever my brother was away at a sleepover. I adore the animations, sound design, and story. Lots of great memories with this film.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky">Castle in the Sky</a></h3>
    <p>There'll probably be a lot of Ghibli (at least 2), but this is another nostalgic film for me. Even moreso than the more popular Ghibli films like Howl's Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, and Princess Mononoke. Instead, it was Spirited Away and this for me. Surely it was by choice, and not the fact that we only had the DVDs for these two...</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(2007_film)">Earth (2007)</a></h3>
    <p>I think this was the first movie I bought a copy of. My brother and I were allowed to choose a movie to buy at Blockbusters (RIP btw) one time in my childhood. He chose Avatar, and I chose Earth for whatever reason. Seeing as how my dad watched Avatar the whole way through, but fell asleep 30 minutes in to Earth, it's pretty clear which one he preferred.</p>

<h2>Horror Films</h2>
<p>I've gotten in to watching horror with friends lately. While this is an objectively* correct list, I also found that for horror, I don't get many spooks from the "slow-burn" type movies (the good ones). Instead, it's the cheap trashy jumpscare movies that actually gets reactions from me...</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(2022_film)">Smile</a></h3>
    <p>I think this was the movie that kicked off our horror-watching binge. I can't say it was particularly good (plot wise), but it was certainly an entertaining movie. The last scene where the entity vored the characters was especially beautiful and not hilarious at all. Prime cinema.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(2023_film)">Thanksgiving (2023)</a></h3>
    <p>Again, can't say it was a particularly good movie, but it was certainly memorable and often gets memed on in my group of friends. Especially that scene with the trampoline and knife... I think everyone remembers that scene quite vividly.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh:_Blood_and_Honey_2">Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2</a></h3>
    <p>The second is objectively better than the first. In the first, the costumes for Winnie and Piglet was comical at best. It just looked like some guy with a scuffed bear/boar mask instead of my childhood book characters turnt in to murdering maniacs. At least in the second film, the plot gets completely revamped (and retconned), and the costumes become much, much better.
    <br/>
    Fun fact, Tigger wasn't in the first movie (or ever mentioned I don't think) because that character was still under copyright - which the other characters left as of the making of the film. So, when they made the second film, Tigger also left copyright, and hence, he can join his lovely group of friends once again.
    <br/>
    Also, I don't know if that fun fact is actually true or not. But I'll continue to perpetuate it without fact checking it.
